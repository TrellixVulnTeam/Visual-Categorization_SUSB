Visual Categorization
=====================


The goal of this project is to create a single repository containing python implementations of various visual
categorization models along with publicly available datasets.
The corresponding github repo is: https://github.com/harishbalakrishnan3/Visual-Categorization.
This is an ongoing project. If you find any errors or if you wish to contribute new models/datasets to this repo,
feel free to contact me at: harishbalakrishnan3@gmail.com


The documentation is organised into two main sections :

Categorization Models
---------------------
    Contains the documentation for various categorization modules. For every model, an example python script is also
    supplied that illustrates the usage of the module by reproducing results from corresponding journal papers.


Datasets
--------
    Contains publicly available behavioural data from various categorization experiments. All datasets are compressed
    in zip files. Datasets that are less than 100 MB can be downloaded directly from here. For larger datasets, the
    hyperlink will take you to the GitHub repo from where you can download them.
