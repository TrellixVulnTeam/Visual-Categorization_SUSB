Visual Categorization
=====================

This is the documentation for the repository : https://github.com/harishbalakrishnan3/Visual-Categorization

The site is organised into two main sections :


Categorization Models
---------------------
    Contains the documentation for various categorization modules. For every model, an example python script is also
    attached that illustrates how the module could be used.


Datasets
--------
    Contains publicly available behavioural data from various categorization experiments. All datasets are compressed
    in zip files. Datasets that are less than 100 MB can be downloaded directly from here. For larger datasets, the
    hyperlink will take you to the GitHub repo from where you can download them.

This is an ongoing project. If you wish to contribute to it, contact me at: harishbalakrishnan3@gmail.com
