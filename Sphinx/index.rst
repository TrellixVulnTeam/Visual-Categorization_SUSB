Visual Categorization
=====================

This is small pet project of mine. The objective is to create a single repo where visual categorization models are
implemented in python along with publicly available datasets. The corresponding github repo
is: https://github.com/harishbalakrishnan3/Visual-Categorization

The documentation is organised into two main sections :

Categorization Models
---------------------
    Contains the documentation for various categorization modules. For every model, an example python script is also
    attached that illustrates how the module could be used.


Datasets
--------
    Contains publicly available behavioural data from various categorization experiments. All datasets are compressed
    in zip files. Datasets that are less than 100 MB can be downloaded directly from here. For larger datasets, the
    hyperlink will take you to the GitHub repo from where you can download them.

This is an ongoing project. If you find any errors or if you wish to contribute more models/datasets to this repo, feel free to
contact me at: harishbalakrishnan3@gmail.com
